#Library Status Dashboard

This project consists of two main microservices for managing a library system:

Book Service: Manages book information (retrieve, add, update, delete, and update book status).
Borrowing Service: Handles the borrowing and returning of books.
Additionally, it includes a Eureka Discovery Service for service discovery, allowing the Book and Borrowing services to communicate with each other.
